A truly useful exaflop at de facto FP32 The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw. The interior design is. @Nereide Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor @freewalletorg Your app sucks @ajtourville Haha @niksanae Ok @nnalinas @BBCScienceNews Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people! @TheOnion It was a beast compared to the VIC-20 @MstrOfUniverse @PPathole @EvaFoxU Yup @ajtourville Yes @AdamKIotz @Suvitruf @archillect Sure @HumanoidHistory The Promise is greatly needed Speedrunning Factorio in real life  @Erdayastronaut @ProgrammerDude Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons & min is ~90 tons, so theyre actually quite similar. Both Merlin & Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner & Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound. Congratulations SpaceX Team! @blue_bnd @EvaFoxU @Tesla Even more @justpaulinelol @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Wow, a lot has happened in 10 years! @flcnhvy @h3_extrachars Its a step in that direction @flcnhvy @MarcusHouseGame A few months @NASASpaceflight Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didnt open, triggering an automatic abort. Well figure out why & retry tomorrow. @its_menieb Live by the sword, die by the sword Call of Booty, great game @bradyleonard Well, I do care very much about sustainability of civilization, but there is some truth to the irony part haha RT @JimBridenstine: NEWS: Teams from @NASA and @SpaceX remain GO with plans to bring @Astro_Doug and @AstroBehnken home to Earth on Sunday Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodler @EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Wont need to wait for FSD. @haya2e_jaxa Congratulations! @harsimranbansal Haha @flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. Its just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian. @AstroJordy @flcnhvy @DJSnM Boring Co tunnel in Vegas is only a few months from being operational As seen from an external observer, not the participants @Tesmanian_com Taste of the future @4thFromOurStar Playing the long game Astronaut launch today! @teslaownersSV Ok Good piece on Giga Berlin construction Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday RT @SpaceX: Starman, last seen leaving Earth, made its first close approach with Mars todaywithin 0.05 astronomical units, or under 5 mill @SpaceX Standing down for today to inspect rocket.

We are prioritizing emergency responders & locations with no Internet connectivity at all. @WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt). @cleantechnica No, but you make some great points. Important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem. @teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged. @BBCScienceNews Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo @flcnhvy Progress is accelerating @Tesmanian_com Accurate distance calculation using only vision is fundamental.

The most entertaining outcome is the most likely Hollywood should just start with the sequel & skip the original, because financials @jwangARK Tesla FSD computers dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes  they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails. @Ostimusic We will make super efficient home hvac with hepa filters one day Where are the memes?

Pushing it for near-term tests doesnt achieve anything, but Im confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights. @brian_heide @Tesla What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails? @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX That said, the ship landing burn has a clear solution. My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid & full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth. @karpathy If they dont love us, were in deep trouble! @RationalEtienne @atNickVega @TheOnion  @Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. Theyre coming. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp) @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc It would appear that their calculations were incorrect @austinbarnard45 Mars is looking real @ID_AA_Carmack Ray tracing on Cyberpunk with HDR is next-level. Have you tried it? @OwenSparks_ The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food & beverage, some medical (eg syringes) & toys Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a rocket scientist, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon. @enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didnt realize that was possible. No problem if theres a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe! @tobyliiiiiiiiii Are we sure this is real? @bart_sanders Working on it.

Thats very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory. 

And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Arent there more important issues? @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. Its enough. Improvements in work. @cleantechnica To my surprise, Tesla has better AI hardware & software than Waymo (money) @MrBeastYT I whistle @samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) & then creating video segments for labeling & training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten. @vm_one1 @waEMD @SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. Im a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it. @teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions @jack Lets make the roaring 20s again! @flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut Probably wise @Grimezsz Dogecake Due to unfavorable weather, we are standing down from today's launch; the team will continue with the countdown until T-30 seconds for data collection. Another launch attempt is available tomorrow, January 24 with a 22-minute window opening at 10:00 a.m. EST @PPathole @Erdayastronaut Doesnt seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure. @lexfridman We are mobile cell colonies @ValaAfshar Much more than this & increasing rapidly Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. Whats the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests? @Erdayastronaut 107 expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle. @RocketLab Congrats! @Erdayastronaut Yeah, will post shortly @sama Ancient Greece had it all & then committed suicide.

ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions. @WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I cant emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. @FrancisSuarez @CityofMiami Cars & trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases & particulate, but @boringcompany road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic & be an example to the world. 

Spoke with @RonDeSantisFL about tunnels last week. If Governor & Mayor want this done, we will do it. @FutureJurvetson @flcnhvy True RT @boringcompany: Rumor has it that "Austin Chalk" is geologically one of best soils for tunneling. Want to find out? Austin jobs now avai @cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another cars exhaust pipe. @DMC_Ryan @C_R_H_M @Tesla Cybertruck doesnt need a garage @thatt3slaguy @flcnhvy @PPathole @IheartTesla Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself (if thats even necessary). This is the best thing I can think of to ensure that collective human will decides the future. @WholeMarsBlog Accurate @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks & relight would be a major win. @PPathole Just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency. Dont care if or where they went to school. @GerberKawasaki Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind. @PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship @cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert & careful drivers. @SpaceNews_Inc Starlink poses a hazard to Viasats profits, more like it.

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories. @PPathole @Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too. Cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice. @cleantechnica I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety @IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog I definitely need to try these tasty cakes & pastries on my next visit! @QuantaMagazine init void @ElonsWorld @Real_Futurist @lexfridman Yes @Mike94160775 @Tesla @ElectrekCo @Teslarati Glad youre ok!

Touching words from @Astro_Doug as @ @WholeMarsBlog Human overseen at first, then fully self-driving @WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack & front & rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. 

Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont & Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven. @MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs. Acquisition of signal expected in 5 mins @Teslarati @13ericralph31 This is incorrect @PPathole @ErcXspace @SpaceX *cooling haha @austinbarnard45 Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but well provide video, warts & all. You will see every frame that we do. @Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents @Erdayastronaut Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions. @PPathole @BBCScienceNews This thing we call money is just a (slow, lossy & unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor & necessitate UBI. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point.

New Roadster wheels will only have one nut. @Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force.

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area.

It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine & scientific progress is not impeded. @Sneakyness One of the all time best @comma_ai Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Cant speak for regulators though. @WholeMarsBlog @cleantechnica In a few months in production release. Already does that in alpha build. @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close  a tantalizing local maximum  but reality is just too messy & weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once. @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups & restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device. Both fairing halves caught from space by @SpaceX ships! @PPathole @IEEESpectrum @neuralink A nightcap would probably work best @frydave @youyanggu @DFisman Yeah @OMGROFLOLJK Good point @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX For sure @nytimes Very impressive mission by China! @commander_cruz Might actually happen @EvaFoxU @schristakos @BernieSanders Haha @PPathole That is the near-term danger of AI @HyperChangeTV Tesla team has done great work! @BoredElonMusk  @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days @TechAmazing Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried) @EuricSanti @luisabinader @Tesla Thank you, Tesla is most honored! @Teslarati More software improvements coming @cleantechnica Giga Berlin will come together at an impossible-seeming speed. The prefabricated construction method in Germany is extremely impressive. @conexionspacial @spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Interesting @RBReich All Tesla workers also get stock, so their compensation increased proportionately.

Im using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet. @IvanEscobosa @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or 11. @electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. Its not a question of money. If there was a great engineer factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare.

Tony was great. @ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes, although I didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years. @Kristennetten That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale, it must be fully automated, like LASIK. @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles? @Gfilche @YahooFinance Yahoo Finance is as dumb as it sounds @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight @NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed. @C_Bass3d @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger & therell be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing. @Teslarati Important to service very high latitudes @TheOnion  @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor. @JohnnaCrider1 @Iupsychdoctor @AOC @RobinhoodApp Shopify is great too. SpaceX used them. No need to be a gigachad to own @XHNews Exciting mission! @SciGuySpace Competition ensures companies work hard to serve the needs of their customers @RationalEtienne @TheBabylonBee  @teslaownersSV HG2G Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year. Model 3 rated as most reliable car @WholeMarsBlog Suppliers. Were only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasnt clear that weve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard. @BillRatchet  @DARPA Uh oh @RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point. @TrevorMahlmann @SpaceX Major esthetics improvements coming If you feel Neuralink might have incorrectly overlooked your resume or declined to  make an offer, please lmk in comment below @garyblack00 The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla @homantse28 For a long time @ruskin147 It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas & underweight bringing them to fruition.

No escaping 
that for me @NASASpaceflight Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. 

Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars. @Teslarati Truth is stranger than fiction @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year @song_wooseok @GerberKawasaki @benmezrich  @ScottAdamsSays  @AOC @RobinhoodApp Absolutely @IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog dner kebab @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow.

Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust. @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes @PPathole Another fine day in the simulation  @truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident, but its essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic. RT @JimBridenstine: NEWS: @NASA & @SpaceX are targeting no earlier than Oct. 23 for Crew Dragons first operational mission to the @Space_S @tobyliiiiiiiiii Sure Quite the day ahead @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Legs would certainly work, but best part is no part, best step is no step @eugenelee3 @engineers_feed Yup @tweetmenima @teslaownerssv If next weeks release looks good, we will widen beta @ID_AA_Carmack @lexfridman A bit more obscure, but Starhammer & Stainless Steel Rat @RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max. @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights @bluemoondance74 @StephenKing Cold symptoms are gone for now  Sandstorm is a masterpiece @BucketHat1 This one stings @cleantechnica True fact @flcnhvy Giant gap between experimental medical device for use only in patients with extreme medical problems & widespread consumer use.

It was designed from the beginning with human spaceflight in mi @Erdayastronaut @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Mostly for employees, but well support public access whenever its safe & secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary. @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal. Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California @MKBHD Its next-level @PrisonPlanet Whether commercial or government, monopolies are bad for the people @ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like Im living in a Dilbert cartoon @SciGuySpace Especially for boost stage, which is volumetrically constrained, CH4 is way better than H2. Soviet CH4 engine prototypes from 80s were very advanced. Glad to see reusability is being factored in. @CowderySedge @tbdnonymous Very real possibility @bad_at_life @WholeMarsBlog Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.

Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere. @RGVaerialphotos ~9007mm RT @NASASpaceflight: LAUNCH! Starship SN5 has launched on a 150 meter test hop at SpaceX Boca Chica.

Under the power of Raptor SN27, SN5 h @PPathole @michaelmina_lab Yes mtr trnd @cleantechnica Lithium is extremely common on Earth. Found almost everywhere. @richierichhhhh_ Absolutely @stevewoz Definitely @flcnhvy @lexfridman Yeah @michaelmina_lab Great thread @DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give? Just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!? @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV Haha ok New SpaceX droneship will be called A Shortfall of Gravitas @flcnhvy Yes, and then Occams razor is actually third most likely @IEEESpectrum @neuralink Pretty much @WorldAndScience If you ever wondered where we came from @Teslarati Much appreciated. This was a serious attack. @erigganewmoney  @PPathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All of that and more. Were doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range & regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person. @Vasu42698392 @amyceskridge Chip has temp sensor & automatically maintains safe temp RT @SpaceX: Due to unfavorable weather, we are standing down from today's launch; the team will continue with the countdown until T-30 seco @alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster & 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster & fairing by end of next year. RT @jaxzin: Power is flowing again from the grid. 
Grateful for my @Tesla #Powerwall and 162 hours of uninterrupted backup power.  ht @RexChapman Haha @WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations. @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, were making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture. First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Probably @Breedlove22 @benmezrich The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. 

What actually matters is making goods & providing services. 

We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. 

Whichever has least error & latency will win. Much wow! @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV Sure @Kristennetten @flcnhvy Was just there & weather was calm. Sure hope it stays that way!  @teslaownersSV @lexfridman Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check. @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Yes @Erdayastronaut After it gets to orbit a few times @josh_bickett @PPathole Yes @RGVaerialphotos Lord of the  @flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes Please trash me on Wikipedia, Im begging you @SamTalksTesla Im ok, thanks for asking.

Were applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers. @akinfermo Yeah, would have been way better just to send everyone $6k @waitbutwhy So true @RationalEtienne @TheBabylonBee This is an important distinction @SpaceX @Space_Station Its called the Space Station, but its actually moving around Earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet @kenyanwalstreet Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock cant be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought & income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years. One word: Doge @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs @naval [Some tyranny]. Also, the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions. @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha @picot_john @CyberpunkGame Its a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great @WR4NYGov @BernieSanders Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies. @johnkrausphotos @Patreon @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars @karpathy Haha true @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking @AstroJordy Yes @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too @ErcXspace @SpaceX It will have landing legs @PPathole @WholeMarsBlog Yes.

Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world. @PPathole @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. Well hopefully fix the leak today & retest. @AustinTeslaClub @TheBabylonBee Probably commenting on @signalapp will do more @teslacn Congratulations Tesla China for amazing execution last year. Now on to the next for even more!! @BBC_Future Good article @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision. @smvllstvrs @ErcXspace Rocket motion is primarily vertical, so you want the top open @Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses & general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.

 This is the 1st @WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load.

Both operating on (SpaceX) autopilot. @teslaownersSV @lexfridman You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it? Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems) @NASASpaceflight Passed cryo proof @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldnt blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval. @wintonARK Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low.

Will wait until figurative & literal dust settles. It can play Cyberpunk @lnterestingMaps @Iearnsomethlng  @westcoastbill Indeed @TeslaTested Thats an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease. @michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If Im asking the wrong question, what is a better question? @austinbarnard45 @lrocket Sure hope that future doesnt come to pass! @sri_myneni @Erdayastronaut @considercosmos @SpaceX Sound & flame color will be quite different @WholeMarsBlog Therell be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The open areas inside are covered. Theyre internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building. These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers. @BBCScienceNews Similar problem with US data @teslascope Were switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major & minor updates. Current build is FSD 8.1. It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA & back last night with no interventions! @91demigod No, but maybe one day @Erdayastronaut Most likely @EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but its fun & takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. @WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails. @Tesmanian_com Yes @Dota2funny1 @CyberpunkGame Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great @CryptoShrikar @CoinDesk @Tesla @Dan_Z_Palmer  @ID_AA_Carmack Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user. @cleantechnica Definitely not. Smartwatches & phones are yesterdays technology, Neuralinks are the future. @a_howard8 Yes @tomdestella I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload @WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah @OLHZN Minor @PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps & drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield & go high Mach. @wimgrommen @WSBChairman Indeed. The economy  making useful products & providing great services  is what actually matters. @engineers_feed Tbh, I must confess to occasionally pontificating about high-concept things @johnkrausphotos @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX  @DJSnM Preburners ignite, then main chamber @NASASpaceflight SN40 is about to be tested & has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force. @engineers_feed Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O &gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions & Earth too over time. @Couch_Investor Yes @Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT Thats very hard to do.

Difficult time. @WholeMarsBlog   @StephenKing There are degrees of pos @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind. @cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid is an equally correct title.

As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off. @aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate @TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this. With Cyberpunk, even the hotfixes literally have hotfixes, but  great game @slashdot An AI with  picking as its goal will result in Strawberry Fields Forever We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves. @28delayslater Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year.

Were labeling bumps & potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so. @ICannot_Enough Yes @PPathole Probably @PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. Theyre great places to get spare parts. @Kristennetten Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you & maybe help out new owners, that would be cool @Erdayastronaut Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km.

In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but thats more of a long-term solution. @cleantechnica Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle & pedestrian traffic. Frame rate & latency from frame to wheel vector change also important. @AfloatHickory Haha I will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts 5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far. @engineers_feed Engineering is magic made real @LinusTech @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX   @TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. 

Its already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive. @levie Wild times! @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper & lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity & improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough. @teslaownersSV We need a match other traffic speed setting @karpathy Vaccines are just the start. Its also capable in theory of curing almost anything. Turns medicine into a software & simulation problem. @SpaceX Nice work, SpaceX team! Starship SN5 just completed full duration static fire. 150m hop soon. @justpaulinelol @teslaownerssv Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle & shot glasses worldwide. @RationalEtienne @toadmeister Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people & quarantine vulnerable was right though imo. @BenSullins We need a UI overhaul @SpaceX Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US & hopefully southern Canada.

Dean Ono too for Kestrel & Draco. @UniverCurious Extremely misleading image, as doesnt reflect true time cost to people or rain & pain @ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 & SN10 are close behind.

This is a hard problem. Critically, however, this does not require a hardware change to cars in field. @twomad Um  yes @GiulioCoraggio Absolutely, but it doesnt seem that govt can move fast enough @ajtourville Exactly @PPathole @flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes. Could also extend range of hearing beyond normal frequencies and amplitudes. Deus Ex. @MichaelGalanin @kevinmgill Wow @DisruptResearch Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line & new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces. @westcoastbill  @MKBHD Haha @westcoastbill Indeed RT @NASA: This week...

 NASA's @SpaceX Crew-1 astronauts arrive at @NASAKennedy ahead of launch
 Our @NASAPersevere rover marks 100 days @Kristennetten Mimecraft @28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down Solving high-volume, high-reliability, low-cost production problems is especially valued @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight Not having long chain hydrocarbons & lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference @freewalletorg Thanks for fixing @GerberKawasaki They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water & land. We may need something thats ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy. @heydave7 Engineering, design & general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind & are the fundamental limitation on doing more. 

Capital allocation is important, but low CPU load. Tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor, but going private is impossible now (sigh). @cleantechnica But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear theyre across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do. Question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon & what shape? Silicon expands like crazy during discharge & comes apart, so cycle life is usually bad. @Maisie_Williams  Toss a bitcoin to ur Witcher  @mjkapkan @EvaFoxU @Tesla Probably a good one to design & engineer in Germany @katlinegrey Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight. @MonicaLewinsky Try a Tesla & youre welcome to give it back if you decide you prefer a Subaru @TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary & space power. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money. @JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater Sure RT @SpaceX: Splashdown of Dragon confirmed, completing SpaceXs 21st @Space_Station resupply mission and the first return of a cargo resupp @glenn22x @Teslarati @BocaChicaGal Yes @skorusARK The factory is the product I  I just died in your arms tonight Will those who write the algorithms ever realize their negativity bias?  @WholeMarsBlog Haha true @auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too. @itsALLrisky Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.

Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster. @teslaownerssv Indeed @Kristennetten Yeah @Adamklotz_ Its meant to be the same price in all countries. Only difference should be taxes & shipping. More fun games coming soon to ur Tesla @flcnhvy Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations & partying with people your own age. Now, even thats gone. The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other @FNarolles @TGMetsFan98 This is what matters most @philwhln @heydave7 Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so. @EuroSandor @RSprachrohr  @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged @flcnhvy @alvianchoiri Were not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections. @Breedlove22 @benmezrich Only Chuck Norris can divide by zero @Kristennetten @PPathole @BernieSanders  @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height. @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT Its cool & for sure can & should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind & solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky) 100 Off Twitter for a while Dragon will travel from south of New Zealand to Florida in ~37 minutes  Twitter sucks Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics. @PPathole @dixonspace @Kristennetten @CathieDWood Yup. Banks are basically balkanized, heterogeneous databases with high latency & weak security, especially ACH transfers & credit cards. @Dami_Kolz09  @krystof_mitka @BiIndia Winning worst person Ive ever worked with is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title! @Kristennetten  @Erdayastronaut Im wearing your F-1 engine shirt right now! @flcnhvy Exactly Come for the comments, 
stay for the memes @MatthewCable6 @ErcXspace Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster & stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. Well build several ships just to improve the production system. @Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasnt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, its right. @RationalEtienne @BernieSanders I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed @Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year @Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Its counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds! Penguin Random House  should change the name to Random Penguin RT @michaelmina_lab: @elonmusk Great question! Its more complex question and depends on why the test is being used - ie: do you want to kn @ThatDudeShannon @pcgamer FEAR 1 with modern graphics & sound would rock @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. @dauqhx @universal_sci Theres a lot of frozen CO2 & H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. Its solvable. @EvaFoxU That number sure comes up a lot  @Teslarati Tesla Germany designed & built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too @cleantechnica Cool @universal_sci Urf is so sml @tomosman @Tesla Absolutely @SpaceX Hopefully flying tomorrow @AstroJordy @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla For sure @Zog_Fot_Pik @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack Sure @flcnhvy Robot Heart is  @Mark_Goldberg_ @Tesla Note the fabulous plaid jacket & gingham shirt combo  @BabyTesla3 @WholeMarsBlog Yes @eiraum   Dogecoin is the peoples crypto @tesladri @ID_AA_Carmack @lexfridman Should be happening soon @shifthappends @Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units! @lexfridman Good point @flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots & equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots & brought the factory back to life. @flcnhvy Only Halo @flcnhvy Sure @teslaownerssv Next weeks release is special. Lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes & entire new areas of functionality. @ValaAfshar @Tesla Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety RT @SpaceX: Completed a full duration test fire of the Raptor Vacuum engine at SpaceXs rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas http @DisruptResearch Tesla R&D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent Nothing has gaslit more people than the movie Gaslight Watch Demolition Man @flcnhvy @ICannot_Enough @Tesla This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators. @SpaceNews_Inc China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over. @pcgamer FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2. They will haunt your dreams. @itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year. @Erdayastronaut Cold gas for now, hot later @EvaFoxU True @engineers_feed At first, I thought that was a parrot @justpaulinelol @NASASpaceflight Thats engine SN. Were building SN8 of the ship. @Virgin_Orbit Congratulations! @SamTalksTesla Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights @jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor & will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent @ID_AA_Carmack I like C, because it avoids class warfare @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Tesla Roadster will be better @Erdayastronaut @michaelhodapp_ 1. Orbital launch tower that can stack
2. Enough Raptors for orbit booster
3. Improve ship & booster mass @MightyTesla @SamTalksTesla @ElonsWorld @Nikola_Truth @WholeMarsBlog @RenataKonkoly @stevenmarkryan @vincent13031925 @HyperChangeTV @TeslaPodcast Hell of a ride! @PPathole @SpaceX Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!! @lexfridman Clearly @Tesla We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested. @TeslaGong @TeslaTested Yes @teslaownersSV LotR @TesLatino @Tesla Absolutely! They rock.  @Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage. @CoderFoot @m2jr @BernieSanders Yup @DocumentingBTC The dollar is shorting itself @SamTalksTesla London to Beijing would be cool So long, and thanks for the orifice!

I kinda liked the original tbh, but its possible to take it up a level. @wintonARK True RT @CRAdvocacy: The future of cars can and will be electric if the entire industry starts making and marketing compelling EVs for everyone @izzynobre Excuse me, I only sell Doge! @flcnhvy Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls @AdamHoov Yes @AdamBlitzer @levie  @antonkanerva Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna. @Erdayastronaut I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica! @JaneidyEve Or a self-perpetuating autocracy based on a farcical aquatic ceremony where the king is chosen by a wise panzer in a lake Well, almost anything @robintosh_nunez @PPathole Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 & N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of todays test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results. @wonderofscience Destiny @PPathole @Nigel_Lockyer @Penn @Fermilab LHC tbh @WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart @BizzzzzyD You have a point (sigh) @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thats actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows & a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory @cleantechnica Tbh, we are just a bit less foolish than before @TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech @nasahqphoto Too long since we were last there RT @Space_Station: The station and the @SpaceX #Dragon are going into an orbital night period before the 1:30pm ET docking. The #CrewDragon @Erdayastronaut Impressive @Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @ulalaunch @torybruno @MHI_Group @roscosmos @Peter_J_Beck To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale dont lie. @Neuro_Skeptic Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix. @Erdayastronaut The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because its a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home & work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks. @LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter. @SpaceX @Space_Station One day, we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background @BnOrdhaug And starts tweeting  @MKBHD This is accidental. Will be back shortly. @hajek_miloslav Great nails & lipstick @TeslaTested We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one @PPathole @CyberpunkGame Yeah, briefly. Seems pretty good. I picked Nomad, so start was a little slow, but picks up fast. Seemed like almost everyone on Steam was playing Cyberpunk at some point this weekend! @lexfridman Then they leave the house and hardly ever call their parents!

Its when you hang out there that problems arise. @PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO & other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo @RDAnglePhoto @SpaceX @Teslarati Yes, it does. @PPathole We should bring Life to Mars @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Exactly @Techgnostik @RBReich Touch @GiveDirectly Just sent some All three static fires completed & no RUDs! @NASASpaceflight Sea shanty tiktok takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships @Kristennetten @xiang_aw @OwenSparks_ @BernieSanders The government has the most money by far. They talk in trillions. @GerberKawasaki @Tesla Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times  @sfs_central !! Even cheese is made of cake !! @PPathole @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 That is certainly the intention! @NatGeo Must be aliens @ZainRaz4 @PPathole @TashaARK Yes @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM & Chrysler were going bankrupt. This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal @Teslarati I dont think this is accurate @TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan @JaneidyEve Cant say, but it involves a  @djzinc @kenyanwalstreet True haha @bluemoondance74 @PPathole @flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Not that Im aware of @Kristennetten @royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London. @EvaFoxU @waitbutwhy Yup @DMC_Ryan @Tesla It will be awesome @teslaownersSV @engineers_feed The strength & perseverance of the people of Tesla, despite facing extreme difficulties @jackfarrington For sure @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold. Launch in 20 mins Here come the shorty apologists
Give them no respect
Get Shorty @TesLatino Mine is a few days ahead @TechAmazing Looks like snoopy @Astronomiaum Deveras! Successful ascent, switchover to header tanks & precise flap control to landing point! @WholeMarsBlog  @pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point @flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air & land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel) @universal_sci Pretty much A prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. We will teach you whats known about the brain, which is not much tbh. @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog That looks tasty! Some big milestones coming up Story of my life @Teslarati Aiming to make it super fun! @Model3Owners @MKBHD Sure @CathieDWood We arent cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight We will push for ten flights with Starlink @coach23life I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast! @PPathole @cleantechnica Version 1 is about a year away @Dtrford @austinbarnard45 @AlexSvanArt @ErcXspace @SpceEnthusiast @SpacexVision @TomDixonDesign @SpaceX @spaceXcentric Doesnt quite illustrate true size difference. Starship payload volume & mass are &gt;1000% that of Shuttle. The people have spoken  @Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety @Astra Sorry to hear that. Im sure youll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard. @engineers_feed Small fry. The sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second. Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate. @SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case. @kyzcralotSxaM Yes Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. Excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies! @WholeMarsBlog Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!? @TashaARK Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks. So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. @PPathole @SpaceX This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal. @PPathole @maureendowd The song I whistle most is Strangers in the Night @thatt3slaguy @Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT Yes, coming soon @parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!! @MachinePix The robot future is coming @OwenSparks_ Sure @CodeWisdom  @Confiant_man American, but born in South Africa. Left by myself when I was 17. @StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires? @pcgamer A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there werent level-based item limits in a single-player game. @ID_AA_Carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo @speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly @pcgamer I just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled @mkarolian @Tesla Thanks for letting me know. Will dig into it. @PPathole @RhiddhiD Ya just cant beat BR @DMC_Ryan @rodamn Its a prototype of the color @PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Thats the number that really matters
